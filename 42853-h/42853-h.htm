<h2>THE SNUBBED PROFESSIONAL'S
VADE MECUM.</h2>
<p><i>Question.</i> You consider
yourself neglected because, I
presume, the public do not
appreciate you at your proper
value?</p>
<p><i>Answer.</i> That is, indeed,
the case, and for further particulars
I refer you to a recent
correspondence in the <i>Pall
Mall Gazette</i>.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Is it not necessary that
you should acquire an immense
amount of knowledge to undertake
the duties of your profession
worthily?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; and we welcome
any kind of safeguard
that will protect the public
against fraud and imposture.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Then you consider your
profession very seriously?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Undoubtedly. It is the
most important profession in
the world; not a man, woman,
or child exists who has not
derived some benefit from its
exercise.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> If I am not mistaken,
you ought to be educated at
Oxford or Cambridge to do
full justice to your opportunities?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; upon the
foundation of a school training
at either Eton, Westminster,
Rugby, or Harrow.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Ought you not to take
up human and comparative
anatomy?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> As a matter of course,
combined with physiology and
chemistry.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> But does every professor
of your art follow this routine
of work?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Those who are of the
greater worth. There are outsiders
who assume our noble
name and yet know nothing of
our special subject.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Besides the studies you
have mentioned, are there any
others necessary to the formation
of a man of your special
attainments?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Well, it would be well
for an operator to understand
metallurgy and mechanics.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> And have you to cultivate
the graces of the person?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Certainly; you must be
of a pleasing and courteous
presence. You must be fitted
by nature and art to obtain
the confidence of those who
pay you a professional visit.
You must be tender and true.
You must be able to converse
on every subject under the
sun, and distract the attention
of a sufferer from his pains by
causing him to listen to your
anecdotes.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> It seems, then, you must
be an admirable Crichton?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Well, yes, in a small way.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Then what are you
called? May I put down an
archbishop, or a Lord Chief
Justice, or a Prime Minister?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> No, neither. I do not
aspire to be a person of so
much importance.</p>
<p><i>Q.</i> Then what are you?</p>
<p><i>A.</i> Why, merely a dentist!</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h3>At the Fancy Ball.</h3>
<p>"Do look at that huge
woman dancing with Uncle
<span class="smcap">Bob</span>. What is she? A Quakeress?"</p>
<p>"H'm! rather an Earth-quakeress,
I should fancy!"</p>
<hr class="full" />
<h2>FIRST IMPRESSIONS.</h2>
<p><i>En Route to the Mediterranean.</i>&mdash;I am alone, until a Frenchman
and his young wife come in and glare at me, presumably because I
am already there. The ordinary honeymoon couple anywhere are
supercilious enough, and a French honeymoon couple perhaps more
so. If you gaze absently at the back of Madame's hat, when you are
looking at the mountains beyond Madame's head, Monsieur glares
at you with the concentrated fury of an angry menagerie. But a
French couple, travelling in Italy, which loves the Triple Alliance,
develope an air of superciliousness quite unapproached; and when
their solitude is invaded by an Englishman, a native of the country
which occupies Egypt, thousand thunders, it is too strong!</p>
<p>So these two whisper together, and look out of one window, while I
look out of the other, at Viareggio, and the distant Carrara quarries
and other sights. All interesting and beautiful, no doubt, but not to
be compared to what I shall see beyond Spezia. Think of the blue
sea, the glorious hills, the olive woods, the Italian fishing villages,
the orange groves, the gardens and the flowers. Rather better than
that English coast which Londoners know so well, the seashore at
Brighton, probably the ugliest in the world, with the most unpicturesque
town stretching along it. Of course, I shall not see everything
from the train, but I shall at least have the recollection of an
earthly paradise, to torment me ever after when travelling in the
infernal regions of the Underground Railway. November in Genoa;
November in Gower Street! Halloo, this is Spezia!</p>
<p>Now then, look out. Oh, here's a tunnel first. Wait patiently till
we are through the tunnel. By dim light of carriage-lamp perceive
the French people glaring at me. This <i>is</i> a long tunnel. But then
at the end I shall see&mdash;&mdash;Here is the end. Down with the window.
There's the Mediter&mdash;&mdash;Halloo! Another tunnel. Up with the
window. At last this one is coming to an end. Down with the window
again. Look out. There's the Medi&mdash;&mdash;Halloo, another one!
Up with the window again. French people still glare, but, it seems
to me, more mildly. A fellow-feeling of suffocation, no doubt.</p>
<p>Well, this <i>is</i> long. At last we're out. Down with the window once
more. There's the Med&mdash;&mdash;What? Another one. Up with the
window once more. This <i>is</i> a long one. Begin to cough. Frenchman
also coughs. A bond of sympathy. We cough together. Well,
at last we are out of these awful tunnels. Down with the window.
There's the Medit&mdash;&mdash;Up with the window. Another one! These
gymnastics with the windows are most fatiguing. Choke again.
Frenchman also chokes. "<i>Ces tunnels!</i>" he gasps at last, "<i>on
&#xe9;touffe</i>&mdash;&mdash;" Just then the train bursts into daylight, and his
head, as before, goes out of his window, like mine out of my
window. There's the Me&mdash;&mdash;. Another! "<i>Sapristi!</i>" By Jove!
More choking. "<i>Ces chemins de fers italiens&mdash;&mdash;</i>" begins the
Frenchman. Then another burst of daylight and his head and mine
go out. There's the Medit&mdash;&mdash;"<i>Matin!</i>" Great Scott! Agree with
Frenchman. "<i>C'est assommant</i>," says he, "<i>quel pays&mdash;&mdash;</i>" Then
another gap and heads out as before. There's the Mediterra&mdash;&mdash;"<i>Mille
tonnerres!</i>" I'm hanged! Frenchman and I abuse the
line, the tunnels, the bad light and the worse air. Another
interval.</p>
<p>There's the M&mdash;&mdash; "<i>Sacr&#xe9; nom de nom!</i>" Confound! Frenchman
becomes quite friendly. Even Madame says a word or two.
Begin now to disregard half seconds of daylight, and treat it as all
tunnel over two hours' long.</p>
<p>At last arrive at Genoa, our faces streaked with soot, our lungs
full of smoke, our collars nearly black, and all the superciliousness
shaken out of us. Frenchman almost affectionate when we part.
As for the Mediterranean, I should have seen nearly as much of
it at Moorgate Street.</p>

<h3>THE INFANT PHENOMENON.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Little Jap lecturing on the Art of War to the European Representatives.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="poem">
<p>When the song said Jap <span class="smcap">Ah Sid</span> was just nothing but a kid</p>
<p class="i2">Of what <span class="smcap">Alcock</span> dubbed "a race grotesque and savage,"</p>
<p>The Wise West had not a notion of the kick-up and commotion,</p>
<p class="i2">The naval noise and military ravage,</p>
<p>That same "little kid" would raise; of the p&#xe6;ans of loud praise</p>
<p class="i2">The Wise Boy of the East would hear around him.</p>
<p>A pupil of the West he was held, but, upon test,</p>
<p class="i2">A teacher, in his way, the West has found him.</p>
<p>Phenomenal young Jappy, Occidental Powers seem happy</p>
<p class="i2">To gather round and watch the object lesson</p>
<p>In the wicked Art of War, seeing proof you've carried far</p>
<p class="i2">In matters which before we might but guess on.</p>
<p>If a kid, he's not a fool! With his ferula and stool,</p>
<p class="i2">His blackboard and his lump of chalk, he's showing</p>
<p>How to work an ironclad! It's amazing that a lad</p>
<p class="i2">With a lemon-face should be so wondrous knowing!</p>
<p>He'll teach you to work as <i>he</i> does in the matter of torpedoes,</p>
<p class="i2">And how to blow a rival fleet to blazes.</p>
<p>In naval matters practical, strategical and tactical,</p>
<p class="i2">The nipper shows a <i>nous</i> that almost dazes.</p>
<p>Though his names and terms sound funny, it is more than even money,</p>
<p class="i2">That he hides a lot of wisdom in his lingo.</p>
<p>And what matter baggy breeches, and a speech all "his" and "ichis,"</p>
<p class="i2">If this "Boy" can give the Chinese Giant stingo?</p>
<p>His phiz looks flat and pasty, and his head-gear's hardly tasty,</p>
<p class="i2">And his eyes are like black-beetles set a-swivel.</p>
<p>But though plain or currant-bunny, and the colour of fresh honey,</p>
<p class="i2">He's as full as <span class="smcap">Had&#xe9;su</span> of dash and "divil."</p>
<p>See, those eyes are all a-twinkle! Like the sudu-mushi's tinkle</p>
<p class="i2">Fall his accents very suave, but full of gumption;</p>
<p>And you'll hardly now find any to retort, "Oh, teach your granny!"</p>
<p class="i2">Or to twit the "little kid" with youth's presumption.</p>
<p>For the stalwart Teuton listens, and the Great Bear's optic glistens,</p>
<p class="i2">And the "Melican" "lays low and don't say nuffin',"</p>
<p>Save to whisper to <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>, "He's no mug, by a jug-<i>full</i>,</p>
<p class="i2">Who out of the Chinee has knocked the stuffin'!</p>
<p>Infant phenomenon? Wal, I rayther guess he's gone</p>
<p class="i2">And chalked it out a caution. He's a spry 'un!"</p>
<p>And <span class="smcap">John Bull</span>, who'll have to strain to keep monarch of the main,</p>
<p class="i2">Thinks the infant Jap a chap to keep <i>his</i> eye on!</p>

<h2>GENEROSITY UNDER DIFFICULTIES.</h2>
<h3>(<i>The Question of the Day.</i>)</h3>
<p><i>Daisy.</i> I want to buy a Christmas present for <span class="smcap">Jack</span>. Do you see
anything you think he would like?</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> Here's a morocco case with seven razors, one for each day
of the week.</p>
<p><i>Daisy.</i> Lovely! But <span class="smcap">Jack's</span> got whiskers and a beard.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> So he has! Then why not this exquisite silver cigar-ash
tray?</p>
<p><i>Daisy.</i> Yes, that would be <i>just</i> the thing; only, unfortunately,
<span class="smcap">Jack</span> never smokes, and always walks out of the room if anybody
else does.</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> Oh! That's awkward. This drinking-horn&mdash;what do
you think of <i>it?</i></p>
<p><i>Daisy</i> (<i>gloomily</i>). I'm afraid <span class="smcap">Jack's</span> a Blue Ribbonite.</p>
<p><i>Violet</i> (<i>after a pause</i>). He needn't use it for drinking from. It
would do for a flower-vase, if it had a stand. Anyhow, let's make
haste and choose <i>something</i>.</p>
<p><i>Daisy.</i> I would give him this lovely ink-bottle, only he uses a
type-writer. Ah, I have it&mdash;a purse!</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> The question is whether <span class="smcap">Jack</span> has it, not you.</p>
<p><i>Daisy</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). Yes, a purse it shall be. <span class="smcap">Jack</span> never has
any money&mdash;but <i>that</i> is only a detail. Showy, isn't it?</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> Awfully pretty! Made in Germany, too, it says; <i>that</i>
makes it so much more romantic.</p>
<p><i>Daisy</i> (<i>groaning</i>). Come away! <span class="smcap">Jack's</span> a <i>morbid</i> patriot. Won't
<i>look</i> at a thing not made in England. I must choose some other
day. And we shall be horribly late for lunch. Really, present-choosing
isn't as easy as one thinks!</p>
<p><i>Violet.</i> Not for <span class="smcap">Jack</span>, at any rate!</p>

<p><i>Sir Arthur.</i> "Then <i>Box&mdash;&mdash;</i>"</p>

<a href="images/005.png"><img width="100%" src="images/005.png" alt="" /></a>
<p>"Up in the morning early."</p>
</div>
<p>A great deal is expected from the collaboration of Sir <span class="smcap">Arthur
Sullivan</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">F. C. Burnand</span>, more especially when the work is
staged at the Savoy, and is brought out under the direction of Mr.
<span class="smcap">D'Oyly Carte</span>. The brilliant audience that gathered on Wednesday
night for the first performance of <i>The Chieftain</i> evidently came full
of expectation, and as evidently went away filled with satisfaction.
Twenty-seven years ago, when they were boys together, B. and S. (that
sounds friendly and refreshing) brought out an early version of the
opera which they called <i>The
Contrabandista</i>. After the rehearsal
of the new piece had
gone forward for some weeks,
<span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan</span> stumbled
over this rather difficult word
and sprained his ankle. Whereupon
F. C. B., with characteristic
promptitude and originality,
changed the name to
<i>The Chieftain</i>. That is the
call-boy's narrative of events.
However it be, since the opera
has been entirely re-written,
enlarged and beautified, it
was natural to bestow upon it
a new title. On the first night
<i>The Chieftain</i> stormed the
passes to public favour, and
appears likely to occupy them
for some time. Nothing
brighter in colour, fuller of
life, more musical, more mirthful,
has been seen at the Savoy
since its palmiest days. Sir
<span class="smcap">Arthur</span> and Sir Author are
perfectly mated, F. C. B.
brimming over with genuine
humour, and A. S. pre-eminently
displaying his rare gift
of expressing humour in musical
notes. The cast is a very strong one, which is fortunate, seeing the
appetite of the audience is insatiable, and only exceptional strength
could meet the demand for encores. Where all excel it is difficult to
particularise merit. But Miss <span class="smcap">Florence St. John</span> and Mr.
<span class="smcap">Courtice Pounds</span> in the French duet, Mr. <span class="smcap">Passmore</span> from first to
last (especially in his Bolero dance, one of the funniest things for
a long time seen on the operatic stage), Miss <span class="smcap">Emmie Owen</span> in her
graceful movements, and the sextet with its merry music and its
laughing dance, are things to see and hear.</p>

<h2>THE NEW HEROINE.</h2>
<h3>(<i>A Scene from the Drama of To-morrow.</i>)</h3>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> And do you really love me?</p>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> With all my heart and soul; and yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> Yet what? <span class="smcap">Angelina</span>, why do you look so strangely at
me? There is something on your mind, something you have not the
courage to tell me.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width:40%;">
<a href="images/006.png"><img width="100%" src="images/006.png" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>, I can hide nothing
from you. Even though it should wreck
both our lives, you have the right to know
the truth.</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> My own darling, what is in your
heart?</p>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> Can you bear to hear it? Don't
look at me, or I shall not have the courage
to say what must be said. <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>, I have
never lived a disreputable life.</p>
<p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>burying his face in his hands</i>).
Great Heaven! and I believed in you so
utterly. (<i>Then rising, with a desperate
effort to control his emotion.</i>) Good-bye.</p>
<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>falling on her knees, and
clinging to him</i>). Ah, no, you shall not go.
Think of it, <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>, of the temptations to
virtue that surrounded me, of the examples
of simple girlhood that poisoned my youth.
If I have lived a life of spotless innocence,
remember, at least, that I knew no better.
What else could I do? Brought up from
earliest infancy by a mother of unblemished
reputation?</p>
<p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>with a gesture of horror</i>). Your mother, too? <span class="smcap">Angelina</span>,
our marriage is impossible.</p>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> How hard you men are. Is your sex alone to have the
monopoly of innocence? Must there always be one law for women
and another for dramatic authors? Oh, it is cruel! cruel! But you
will not leave me. Remember, I am still young: it is never too late
to err. And is it because I am a woman that I am to be denied the
chance of retrieving the innocence of a mis-spent youth by the indiscretions
of a riper womanhood? Besides, are there not cases, cases
known to us both where a wife has lived down the terrible reproach
of a blameless girlhood? Why, even Mr. <span class="smcap">Jones's</span> latest heroine, and
there is nothing later than that, could not absolutely prove she had
gone wrong, and yet her husband took her back! But you are so
proud, so relentless. You have no pity in your heart.</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> Believe me, it is not pride. For myself, I would gladly
brave the censure of the world, and if in after years men should say
in scorn he married her though there was nothing against her, I
should still be happy, knowing I had your love. But my father,
that dear old man in his quiet, country vicarage. Think of it? It is
too horrible!</p>
<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>with bowed head.</i>) You are right, I had forgotten your
father.</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> How could I ever look into that sweet, wrinkled face, and
meet those reverend eyes, knowing that I was asking him to receive
as a daughter one who had never even once strayed from the paths of
virtue?</p>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> I see it all now, good-bye.</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> Good-bye.</p>
<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>as he is going</i>). <span class="smcap">Edwin</span>, come back.</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> Ah! don't torture me, I can bear no more!</p>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> But what if I were to tell you that this confession, so
humiliating to us both, was but a ruse to test the strength of your
devotion.</p>
<p><i>Edwin.</i> Ah, don't raise a false hope within me, only to plunge me
again in the abyss of despair.</p>
<p><i>Angelina.</i> But this is no false hope.</p>
<p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>eagerly</i>). What do you mean?</p>
<p><i>Angelina</i> (<i>burying her head on his shoulder</i>). I mean that I
been no better than I should be.</p>
<p><i>Edwin</i> (<i>embracing her</i>). My own true love, nothing can part us
now.</p>

<h2>THE TRUISMS OF LIFE.</h2>
<p>(<i>By the Right Hon. the Author of "The Platitudes of Life,"
M.P., F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D.</i>)</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Chapter II.</span>&mdash;<i>De Quibusdam Aliis.</i></p>
<p>"Cleanliness is next to Godliness"; so runs the witty aphorism;
and modern bacteriologists "explain clearly the reason, <i>and</i> show
why it is so,"<a name="fna_1" id="fna_1" href="#f_1"><small>[1]</small></a> the italics not being in the original. The use of
water is an effectual element in cleanliness. Men have been known
to brush their teeth with it. Of soaps there are many; but water is
practically one. "&#x3a0;&#x3ac;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x1fe5;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;," said <span class="smcap">Thales</span>. And, again, "There is
a tide in the affairs of men,"<a name="fna_2" id="fna_2" href="#f_2"><small>[2]</small></a> as Lord <span class="smcap">Byron</span> put it, in confirmation
of <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> previous statement.</p>
<p>Fresh air contributes largely to the health. "<i>In a&#xeb;re salus</i>," said
the Romans; though some, for want of knowledge, have rendered
this, "There is safety in flight"; and others, for want of the
di&#xe6;resis, have supposed it to mean, "Tip a policeman, and he will
carry you over the crossing."</p>
<p>Yes, indeed, how wonderful is the air! Not only confined, as in
a&#xeb;rated bread or waters, but in the open. By it we breathe and
smell and sail on ships. Also the fields are full of buttercups. And
then the weather! How much of true happiness depends on conversation,
and how much of this on the weather! Yet "there is really
no such thing as bad weather, only different kinds of good
weather."<a name="fna_3" id="fna_3" href="#f_3"><small>[3]</small></a> This true thought has often helped me in a London fog.</p>
<p>Again, the open air suggests games and railways. "Games are
admirable."<a name="fna_4" id="fna_4" href="#f_4"><small>[4]</small></a> Did not Lord <span class="smcap">Nelson</span> rightly say that the battle of
Trafalgar was "won in the playing-fields of Eton?" He referred of
course to the floods. Railways take us about through the air.
<span class="smcap">Ruskin</span> speaks of the advantage of increasing the "range of what
we see," forgetting for the moment his views about locomotives.</p>
<p>Among other forms of recreation men reckon Art and meals and
their wives' relations. I say nothing of the Drama, though the other
day I came across the statement that "All the world's a stage."<a name="fna_5" id="fna_5" href="#f_5"><small>[5]</small></a></p>
<p>Another recreation is letter-writing. Lord <span class="smcap">Chesterfield</span> wrote
letters. But be careful. If you have written a cruel letter, put a
stamp on it, lest it come back upon your own head.</p>
<p>I have spoken of a man's wife's relations. This implies marriage.
"The wise choice of female friends is ... important."<a name="fna_6" id="fna_6" href="#f_6"><small>[6]</small></a> "Grapple
them to thy soul with hoops of steel,"<a name="fna_7" id="fna_7" href="#f_7"><small>[7]</small></a> as a writer lately put it,
thinking, perhaps, of the Elizabethan skirt. There are risks in marriage.
It is "for better for worse."<a name="fna_8" id="fna_8" href="#f_8"><small>[8]</small></a> This distinction is well brought
out in the two following passages&mdash;"And oh! if there be an Elysium
on earth, it is this, it is this!"<a name="fna_9" id="fna_9" href="#f_9"><small>[9]</small></a> and "Wedlock's a saucy, sad,
familiar state."<a name="fna_10" id="fna_10" href="#f_10"><small>[10]</small></a></p>
<p>One might throw out some thoughts on the question of selection,
but, as a friend aptly and originally expressed himself to me&mdash;"Silence
is golden"; and I remember to have read that "talking
should be an exercise of the brain and not of the tongue."<a name="fna_11" id="fna_11" href="#f_11"><small>[11]</small></a> Substitute
"writing" for "talking," and "pen" for "tongue," and I really
wonder why I have written all this. Can it be that I regard the
reading public as "mostly fools"?<a name="fna_12" id="fna_12" href="#f_12"><small>[12]</small></a></p>

<h3>"ONE MAN ONE JOB."</h3>
<p><i>A Christmassy Story for the Members of the L. C. C.</i></p>
<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Blank Threestars</span> was an eminent member of the London
County Council, and had distinguished himself as a supporter of the
cry, "One Man One Job." In his opinion a workman should stick to
his work, and try no other. If he were a bricklayer, he should lay
bricks; if he were a painter, he should daub doors with colour.</p>
<p>"We don't want one man interfering with another man's business,"
said Mr. <span class="smcap">blank Threestars</span>. "Let the shoemaker stick to his last."</p>
<p>And this declaration of policy made him extremely popular in his
own set. He was considered a sound reformer. "Sound" in more
senses than one, as he happened to be particularly partial to the tones
of his own voice.</p>
<p>One day about Christmas time, when the holly and mistletoe were
much in evidence, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blank Threestars</span> happened to be reading
the reports of his own speeches at Spring Gardens, and unconsciously
closed his eyes. When he reopened them, he found a gentleman in a
black costume, who invited him to give his opinion on things in
general and the London County Council in particular. Rather
pleased to be asked to air his eloquence, Mr. <span class="smcap">Blank Threestars</span>
readily complied with the obliging request. He talked long and well,
and the gentleman in black seemed never weary of listening to him.
When he paused for a moment his attentive visitor put a question to
him which "set him off" again. And this was repeated quite a score
of times. At length, however, the orator became exhausted.</p>
<p>"Why do you cease speaking?" asked the gentleman in black
rather impatiently.</p>
<p>"Because I am very tired," was the reply; "and now, with your
permission, I will go for a turn on my bicycle."</p>
<p>"Not at all. Your job is to speak, and I cannot let you do anything
else. So please continue your interesting remarks. What do
you think of the report upon the City of London?"</p>
<p>Poor <span class="smcap">Blank Threestars</span> attempted to give his views on the
subject, but broke down. He was extremely exhausted; but the
gentleman in black kept him going. He insisted upon being answered
this, and answered that, until the eminent Member of the London
County Council became almost senseless with fatigue. He closed his
eyes once more, and when he reopened them, found that his own
servant was standing by his side.</p>
<p>"Going to Spring Gardens, Sir?" asked the faithful adherent.
"If you are it is time to be off."</p>
<p>"No," returned Mr. <span class="smcap">Blank Threestars</span>; "never again. I shall
resign. I have had enough talking to last me a lifetime."</p>
<p>From that moment <span class="smcap">Blank Threestars</span> became a changed character.
He goes in for all sorts of hard work&mdash;wood-cutting, cricket, football,
and golfing&mdash;but he never approaches the L. C. C. In fact, he has
only mentioned Spring Gardens once since his conversion, and then
only to link with its name an expression usually represented by the

<h2>QUEER QUERIES.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Future of Africa.</span>&mdash;Having read in the papers that Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnston</span>,
our Commissioner in Central Africa, advocates the colonising
of that country by "the yellow races," I write to ask if it would be
of any use for me to apply? As I have now suffered from chronic
jaundice for sixteen years, complicated with intermittent attacks of
bilious fever, and, as my skin is usually of a bright orange, I think
that I should fulfil Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnston's</span> requirements down to the
ground. Some of my friends urge me not to go because they are sure
the swampiness of the country would carry me off; but Africa can
hardly be much swampier than Lower Tottenham has been during
the past autumn, and, personally, anything that would really
"carry me off" from the latter place I should welcome as a blessed
change. Perhaps some reader, with more knowledge of Africa than
I possess, could inform me whether there would be much danger of
my yellow complexion, in case of my having a fit of the blues out
there, being converted into <i>green?</i> Would Mr. <span class="smcap">Johnston</span> in that
case regard me as a sort of colourable fraud, and ship me back
home?</p>

<h2>FIZZ AND FUSS.</h2>
<p>Once more America "takes the cake" for grotesque absurdity.
Mr. <span class="smcap">James Payn</span> tells us the teetotal folks there are shocked at the
idea of christening ships with champagne! Well, perhaps it <i>is</i> a
waste of good liquor. "The rosy" in any form must surely be as
completely "thrown away" on the hull of an ironclad as titillation on a
turtle's back or (as <span class="smcap">Sidney Smith</span> put it) the dome of St. Paul's.
The total abstainer, it seems, "on the occasion of baptising a new
liner," sent the President (who was to perform the ceremony) "a
bottle of water as a substitute." The Irishman supplied with
whiskey to clean windows with drank the liquor and <i>breathed on the
glass!</i> Perhaps the President may see his way to taking a leaf out
of <span class="smcap">Paddy's</span> book. Let him drink the fizz (if it is good enough) and
"blow the water-drinkers!" Foolish fanatics! They surely forget
that for every bottle of "the boy" bestowed on an insensible, unappreciative
ship, there is one less left to "gladden the heart of man."</p>

<h2>THE CHRONICLES OF A RURAL PARISH.</h2>
<h3>VII.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Real Thing.</span></h3>
<p>The poll is over, and the Parish Council for
Mudford is at last a <i>fait accompli</i>&mdash;or almost
so. Yet, before I come to relate the story of
the polling, there are one or two matters which,
as a conscientious historian, I think I should
not be justified in omitting.</p>
<p>As I ought to have mentioned before, I did
not think it necessary or expedient in my
candidature to hold any public meetings.
Speaking broadly, I declared to win with
Miss <span class="smcap">Phill Burtt</span> on <i>Canvassing</i>. It was
far otherwise with some of my fellow-candidates.
<span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> and his mates (<span class="smcap">Harry
Jorkins</span> and <span class="smcap">William Brown</span>) got down
from town a young glib-spoken fellow, who
made a magnificent speech, with a Gladstone
peroration, that was supposed to be worth
any number of votes. <span class="smcap">Black Bob</span> (I am
told), in proposing a vote of thanks to him,
somewhat cruelly called him "a cool, honest
and straightforward lecturer." One of these
briefless barristers, no doubt. Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham
Havitt</span> and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span> held a joint
meeting (not to be confounded with a meat
tea) in support of women candidates, addressed
by six enthusiastic ladies who pointed out the
various fields of energy provided for woman
by this new Engine of Reform. The vicar,
the squire, and I, alone out of the eight, contented
ourselves with no perfervid platform
appeals.</p>
<p>I should also state that, as the poll grew
nearer, my wife became increasingly confident
that I should be beaten&mdash;"and that, <span class="smcap">Timothy</span>,"
she added, "you won't like." I pointed out
(and I still think it was a natural thing to do
in the circumstances) that the most formidable
obstacle in the way of my succeeding was
the apparent lack of interest taken in the
affair by my family. This made <span class="smcap">Maria</span> perfectly
furious. I needn't imagine I should
bounce her into it that way; truth to tell, I
never for one moment did think so. She
would go away and stay at our town house
with the girls till the whole affair was over&mdash;which
she did. So, uncheered by wifely counsel
or daughterly devotion, I sallied forth on
the morning of the 17th to my Committee
Rooms, thence to carry on the last stage of
this great contest. I plume myself upon the
excellence of my arrangements. Everywhere
you were bidden (that is you would have
been if you had been at Mudford) to "Vote
for <span class="smcap">Winkins</span>, the Local Candidate." I am
free to admit that there was nothing distinctive
in this description of myself. We were
all local candidates, since we all lived in the
village itself. But this appeal to "local"
feeling is always an excellent card to play.
I know in my own case that I secured five
votes at least from men who at the last
General Election had voted for our sitting
Member because he was the "local candidate."
Then I got some boys to carry round
a Big Loaf and a Little Loaf, adorned with
suitable placards, inciting persons, men and
women, married and single, to vote for me.
I did this because I never knew of an election
yet in which the loaves did not play a prominent
part. I was determined to leave no
electoral device&mdash;legitimate electoral device,
of course, I mean&mdash;untried.</p>
<p>Except for the masterly precision and perfection
of my arrangements, the polling presented
few incidents. There were the usual
number of people who did not find their
names on the register, and who were consequently
turned away sorrowing. (By the
way, is "and who" right? I am never sure.)
Equally, of course, there were some idiots
who would put off voting till it was too
late, and found themselves shut out by one
minute.</p>
<p>At nine the poll closed: and the counting
immediately commenced. I did not feel equal
to the strain of being present, and was represented
by Miss <span class="smcap">Phill Burtt</span>. I waited at
the house in grim suspense. Suddenly I
heard wild cheering. Then a minute later
Miss <span class="smcap">Phill</span> dashed up waving a paper excitedly
and shouting, "Hurrah! Top of the
poll." And so it proved to be. I, who had
been last, was actually now first. Here are
the figures:&mdash;</p>
<table class="poem">
<tr><td><span class="smcap">Timothy Winkins, J.P.</span>         </td><td>219</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">G. Travis-Merton</span> (the Squire) </td><td>203</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">Robert Hedger (Black Bob)</span>     </td><td>203</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">Harry Jorkins</span>                 </td><td>195</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">William Brown</span>                 </td><td>189</td></tr>
<tr><td><span class="smcap">Henry Sandford</span> (the Vicar)    </td><td>172</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham Havitt</span>            </td><td>153</td>
<td rowspan='2'><span style='font-size: xx-large;'>}</span> Tie</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span>              </td><td>153</td></tr>
</table>
<p>I had hardly grasped the significance of
these figures when the crowd surged up over
the lawn. In a few brief, heartfelt words I
thanked them. The greatest moment of my
life&mdash;should never forget this kind appreciation
on the part of those amongst whom I had
lived, and amidst whom I hoped to die&mdash;wished
them all a merry Christmas and good
night. And so&mdash;they went&mdash;home.</p>
<p>The most curious point remains to be noticed.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Letham Havitt</span> and Mrs. <span class="smcap">Arble March</span>
tied for the last place. The Returning Officer
declined to give a casting vote. Oar Parish
Council is to consist of seven Members. The
first six are easy enough to find out. The
latest Mudford puzzle is&mdash;Find the seventh.</p>
<p>I had nearly forgotten to add that my wife
(who comes home to-morrow) has written to say
she hopes I'm satisfied now. Well, I am.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>
<p>A Baronite warns me thusly: In opening <i>The New Standard
Elocutionist</i>, selected by <span class="smcap">Alfred H. Miles</span> (<span class="smcap">Hutchinson &amp; Co.</span>),
you may think there is a mistake somewhere, as on the first page
you are confronted with an anatomical sketch of a cheerful-looking
gentleman with his chest laid open for inspection. Don't be afraid,
it's all right, the gentleman's countenance is reassuring, still, it
makes me wonder if all reciters come to that. But after reading a
little of <span class="smcap">Lennox Brown's</span> chapter, we find it is an object lesson
teaching the usually inflated reciter how to work his diaphragm as it
should be worked. Perhaps its advantages may be felt when the
elocutionist wishes to rouse an admiring but slumbering audience
with a little thundering out of "Rise! sleep no more." If the
average recitation has a soporific effect, <span class="smcap">Phil May's</span> drawings in
<i>Fun, Frolic and Fancy</i>, by <span class="smcap">Byron Webber</span> will soon wake you up.
The annual of three F's quite fulfils the "promise of May."</p>
<p>Though <i>Kitty Alone</i>, by <span class="smcap">S. Baring Gould</span>, runs through <i>Good
Words</i> this year, edited by <span class="smcap">Donald Macleod</span>, D.D., she does it surrounded
by excellent company. Just imagine how a child's preconceived
notions of euphonious spelling will be upset by teaching
<i>Artful Anticks</i> spelt with a <i>k</i>, by <span class="smcap">Olive Herford</span> (<span class="smcap">Gay and Bird</span>).
Such a frivolous liberty to take with any word in these days of solid
moral educational principles.</p>
<p>There always exists a certain sneaking friendly feeling for ghosts,
especially at Christmas time, but it's nothing to the Paddies who experience
a hurtful resentment if you won't listen to their familiar
banshee yarns, and <i>Banshee Castle</i>, by <span class="smcap">Rosa Mulholland</span> is full of
their sighing and wailing; they like to make themselves heard.</p>
<p><i>&#xc0; propos</i> of Christmas numbers, my Baronitess writes: <i>The Queen</i>
and <i>The Gentlewoman</i> present themselves beautifully "got up."
They are both decidedly smart, and, like their titles, their stories are
by a very select company. By-the-bye, in <i>The Gentlewoman</i> the
little bird says that her New Year will open with an exciting
serial, <i>Sons of Fire</i>, from the indefatigable pen of Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon</span>.
There is a hearty, warm sound in it, agreeable at this time of the year.</p>
<p>According to the researching remarks of <span class="smcap">Joseph Jacobs</span>, who has
arranged a new and selected edition of <i>&#xc6;sop's Fables</i> (<span class="smcap">Macmillan
&amp; Co.</span>), one gathers that the "modest violet" is not in it
with the retiring manner in which every other writer of fable have
hidden their worth under the sheltering leaves of the ever green
laurels of Old <span class="smcap">&#xc6;sop</span>. Their number might be termed fabulous. But
<span class="smcap">Sherlock Holmes</span> has not lived in vain. With unerring instinct
the true mythical authors have been tracked, and their deeds
brought to light. The immortal genius may at last enjoy his own
wealth, which he finds fits better now that it has not to be stretched.
Quaint little pictures, done by <span class="smcap">Richard Heighway</span>, adorn the
pages.</p>
<p>"A pretty volume of fairy tales," writes one of the Assistant
Readers, "comes from Messrs. <span class="smcap">Seeley &amp; Co.</span> It is called <i>Lily and
the Lift</i>, and is not only written, but also illustrated, by Mrs.
<span class="smcap">Herbert Railton</span>. <i>Lily</i> herself, the little heroine, who is wafted
in the magic hotel-lift through the regions of Fairyland, is a
darling. Beautiful butterflies, wonderful birds, quaint dwarfs, and
lovely fairies abound in the marvellous country visited by <i>Lily</i>.
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Railton</span> writes with delightful fancy and quiet humour, and
her illustrations add a great charm to a book which is bound to
please the little ones for whom it is intended."</p>

<p><i>In Furthest Ind</i> (<span class="smcap">Blackwood</span>) purports
to be the narrative of Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Carlyon</span>,
of the Honourable East India Company's
service, comprising his escape
from the hands of the Inquisition at Goa,
his journey to the Court of the Great
Mogul, and much else. It all took place
some two hundred years ago, and was
"wrote by his own hand in the Year of
Grace 1697." As for Mr. <span class="smcap">Sydney C.
Grier</span>, he simply "edits the narrative
with a few explanatory notes," which is
very modest of him. The narrative is a
moving one, full of local colour, plastered
on pictures of the outskirts of India in
John Company's day. Mr. <span class="smcap">Edward Carlyon</span>
is a properly pragmatical person, with true British obstinacy
knocking his head against any wall that comes in his way. He
makes my Baronite almost think kindly of the Inquisition. And
this is genial at Christmas time, when we like to think well of
everybody, "and so bless us all, Pen-and-Inkysition included,"

<h2>A SEQUEL TO THE STORY OF UNG.</h2>
<h3>(<span class="smcap">A Fable for those who Resent Criticism.</span>)</h3>
<p><i>In continuation (with apologies) of Mr. Rudyard Kipling's clever
"Story of Ung," in the December Number of "The Idler."</i></p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now <span class="smcap">Ung</span> grew exceeding bumptious along of his scribings on bone;</p>
<p>And he sware that no one could judge them save only the scriber alone;</p>
<p>And he cocked his nose at the critics (save such as effusively praised),</p>
<p>And he prated of "Art for Art's sake," till the tribesmen imagined him crazed.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>And <span class="smcap">Ung</span> grew exceeding abusive, and proudly "uplifted his horn,"</p>
<p>With an Oscar Wildeish swagger, with a more than Whistlerian scorn.</p>
<p>He kicked with the wrath of a <span class="smcap">Kipling</span> at "the dull-brained <i>bourgeois</i> lot,"</p>
<p>(Though he put it in different lingo, for <i>this</i> Billingsgate then was not.)</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>But the prehistoric for "Philistine!" fell from his scorn-curled lips,</p>
<p>And he lashed the non-artistic with words which would cut like whips.</p>
<p>And the non-artistic tribesmen they cried "he is right, this <span class="smcap">Ung</span>,</p>
<p>Though we doubt if the sabre-tooth tiger has got such a rasping tongue:</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But there's truth in his 'Art for Art's Sake,' and Art for him shall suffice."</p>
<p>So they shut him up, with his bones and his tools, in a cave of ice.</p>
<p>No new-cut tongues if the bison, no pelts of the reindeer there,</p>
<p>But only cold snow for cover, and only bare bones for fare.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>For they said, "We are nowise worthy, we hunting and trapping fools,</p>
<p>To judge of his fine bone-scribings, and the way he uses his tools,</p>
<p>Only an artist can judge of an artist's work, and he</p>
<p>Is our only maker of pictures, our only man who can <i>see</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"So he must be artist and critic and purchaser all in one!"</p>
<p>And <span class="smcap">Ung</span> admitted their logic, but he did not see the fun.</p>
<p>He cried "I am cold and hungry!" Then they said, "O picture-man,</p>
<p>Art for Art's sake is your motto; then live on your Art&mdash;<i>if you can!</i>"</p>

<p>And <span class="smcap">Ung</span> essayed to do so&mdash;by gnawing his graven bones,</p>
<p>But he did not find them nourish, and he begged in humbled tones</p>
<p>For a lump of stranded whale-meat, succulent, fat and <i>hot</i>;</p>
<p>In return for which, if they cared for his bones, <i>they might take the lot!</i></p>

<p>And cured the fool of regarding his fellow-mortals as worms.</p>
<p>And whenever ye hear Art crackpots a-wagging an insolent tongue,</p>
<p>Why then&mdash;in the words of <span class="smcap">Rudyard</span>&mdash;<i>heed ye the</i> "<i>Story of Ung!</i>"</p>
